#Rovables Project 

##Introduction
This repository has all the design files to assemble the robots. Rovables are miniature wearable robots that can move around the body. 
See the paper we published at UIST conference [here](http://www.artemdementyev.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Rovables-Miniature-On-Body-Robots-as-Mobile-Wearables.pdf).  

##Content
electronics/ - contains the circuit boards design. They were all designed using Altium, so it might be required to see the original files

mechanical/ - This folder contains mechanical files, done in SolidWorks 2016. 

software/ - contains the software that runs on the devices. We used the Arduino platform, so the robots can be easily programmed.  


##Manufacturing and design

##Known Issues

##Aknowledgements
This project was a collaboration between MIT Media lab (Responsive Environments and Living Mobile) and Shape Lab at Stanford University
